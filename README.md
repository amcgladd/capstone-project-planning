## Project:
AR Textbook (better name TBD)

## Project’s Purpose or Goal:

Paper-based textbooks are not perfect. They lack media like videos, animations, interactivity, 3D imagery.

In response, Apple and other tech companies have tried to get classrooms to transition to an all-digital textbook. We can see this especially with Apple’s iBooks and iTunes University.

However, according to research, students actually prefer paper-based materials citing: they don’t run out of batteries, they cause less eye-strain, they are not dependent on WIFI connections, and students appreciate the touch and permanence of a paper-based material.

Here’s where AR textbooks seeks to be the realistic compromise between paper-based materials and all-digital learning materials. They preserve the all the benefits of paper-based materials, but include AR-enhancements for an enriched learning experience.

AR Textbooks will be written ViroMedia, allowing AR to be viewed with both Apple and Android devices.
